> Since 29 March, 2020, I've decided to translate an English article to Chinese edition everyday, getting started with [*China Daily*](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/).

## （翻译）疫情期间无处不在的二维码    

一个二维码可以有那些信息？答案是多种多样的，比如：一个广告链接，你的电子钱包或一个医院挂号信息。    

但是这个广泛为中国网民所使用二维的电子小方块，在帮助国家从受新冠疫情而关闭的学校和商业中恢复的过程中也扮演着一个日益重要的角色。   

随着越来越多的教育机构在经历了几个月的关闭之后宣布了恢复教学的计划，运行着流行通讯应用软件微信的腾讯控股有限公司发布了一个专用的二维码**复学码**。    

该二维码通过一个特殊的微信程序(译注：企业微信)中的应用而奏效，学生和家长们可以通过这个二维码报告他们的健康情况。   

二维码指向的应用用以记录体温、症状和学生在过去十四天内的行踪。老师和教育系统管理者有权得到这些信息并以此做出更精确的管理。    

中国的所有学校自一月底就关闭了。但是在三月初，随着新的本地感染病例数量逐渐降低，如青海和贵州等的一些省份就宣布了即将到来的重新开学日期。然而像北京上海这种大城市的学校依然没有通知学生什么时候可以返校。   

腾讯表示这一举动标示着二维码在教育领域的最新的应用场景。帮助恢复经济活动的、使用更广泛的健康码已经展示了超过二十五亿次，提供应用的程序也已经得到八十亿次访问。   

通过使用这一记录个人旅行史和其他相关信息的二维码，人们可以查看自己是否能进入公共空间，还是应当接受隔离措施。   

腾讯的对头企业支付宝也使用了类似的健康码帮助商业企业恢复生产。一个值得注意的点是其在餐饮行业的使用，阿里健康码允许服务员和厨师提供健康码以证明他们良好的的健康状况、及他们可以给顾客提供良好的用餐体验。   

阿里表示已经有超过两千六百家餐饮商户加入了这一倡议。   

北京数字经济智库主任黄日韩说，二维码提高了城市管理的透明度、提升了效率和信誉，同时有助于刺激消费。   

## (Original article)   

What's in a QR code? Lots of things: a link to an advertisement, your digital wallet or maybe access to a doctor's appointment.

But the two-dimensional digital square ubiquitous to Chinese internet users is also playing a growing role in helping the nation bounce back from novel coronavirus-related closures of schools and businesses.

Tencent Holdings Ltd, which operates popular messaging app WeChat, has launched a dedicated QR code Fuxuema, which translates as "school resumption code", as a growing number of educational institutions have announced plans to resume classes after months of shutdowns.

Students and their parents can report health conditions via the code, which is available for application through a special WeChat program.

The application makes note of body temperatures, any symptoms developed and students' whereabouts over the previous 14 days. Teachers and education administrators can access such information to help with more precise management.

Schools in China have been closed since the end of January. But some provinces, such as Qinghai and Guizhou－in early March began announcing upcoming reopening dates as the number of new locally transmitted cases gradually fell.

However, schools in major cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have yet to say when they will ask students to return.

Tencent said the move marks the latest application scenario of QR codes in the education realm. A more universal Health Code to help with the resumption of economic activity has been displayed some 2.5 billion times, with the program hosting the service visited 8 billion times.

Using that code, which records people's travel history and other elements, individuals get to see whether they are qualified to enter public spaces－or should follow quarantine rules.

Rival Alipay is also using a similar health code to help businesses resume operations. One notable case in point is its use in the catering sector, allowing service attendants and chefs to present health codes to prove their good health and ensure pleasant dining experiences for patrons.

The company said over 2,600 catering outlets have joined in the initiative.

Huang Rihan, executive dean of Beijing-based think tank Digital Economy, said QR codes add to transparency and elevate efficiency and goodwill in city management while helping to boost consumption.
