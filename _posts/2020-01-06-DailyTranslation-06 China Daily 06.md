## （翻译）北京谴责美国对数据的“不道德”指控   
外交部发言人华春莹在周二例行记者会上说，在新型冠状病毒大流行的背景下，一些美国政客把政治凌驾于人民生命健康之上是“不道德和非人类的”。  

针对美国情报部门声称北京方面瞒报了传染病数据，华春莹驳斥道诋毁、诽谤和推咎责任于他国不仅不能弥补失去的时间，反而会导致失去更多的时间和生命。  

“中国人民非常理解，也非常同情美国人民正遭受的痛苦，”在北京举行的例行新闻发布会上，华春莹表示中国非常乐意提供给美国力所能及的帮助以抗击病毒。   

将公共卫生问题政治化应当为全世界人民——也包括美国人民——所谴责，华春莹说道。同时华春莹敦促美国政客应当把他们的工作优先级、工作方向和重心转移到拯救美国人民生命上来。    

周二，这位发言人也对此前媒体所报道的丹麦自中国购买的口罩的质量问题做出澄清。   

中国官方的初步调查结果显示，报道中的货物是荷兰代理人购买的非医用口罩。华春莹补充说，在出口前这家中国公司已经明确地通知了荷兰方面，海关报备这批货物作为非医用口罩出口。   

“不是所有国家都对传染病防护物资有急迫需求。我们友好地提醒使用者，为避免慌乱之中产生错误，请仔细检查产品的使用目的和使用说明书，确保产品符合他们的标准，”华春莹表示到。   

为确保产品质量，自周三开始，中国官方已经对医疗物资出口实行更严格的审查。海关清关过程中需要出口公司提供额外的文档，以证明他们的产品符合进口国家或地区的质量标准。    

华春莹指责一些境外媒体再明确事实之前不负责任地夸大所谓的中国产品质量问题。华春莹说：“我希望他们(媒体)没有不可告人的动机，因为这对国际合作控制传染病毫无帮助。”   

## (Original article)   

Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said on Thursday that some US politicians are "being immoral and inhuman" for not putting people's lives and health above politics amid the novel coronavirus pandemic.

Rebutting the United States intelligence community's conclusion that Beijing underreported its epidemic data, Hua said that slander, smears and shifting the blame to others cannot make up for lost time, but will only cost more lost time and lives.

"The Chinese people understand very well, and sympathize with the American people for the pain they are suffering now," Hua said at a regular news conference in Beijing, adding that China is willing to provide them with help and support, within its ability, to combat the virus.

Politicizing public health issues should be denounced by people worldwide including those in the US, she said, urging US politicians to adjust their work priorities and direction and concentrate on saving the lives of people in the US.

On Thursday, the spokeswoman also further clarified previous media reports about the quality of masks purchased by the Netherlands from China.

According to an initial investigation by Chinese authorities, the reported shipment was of nonmedical masks purchased by a Dutch agent, Hua said, adding that the Chinese company had explicitly notified the Dutch before shipment that they were exported as nonmedical masks in the customs declaration.

"Now all countries urgently demand epidemic prevention materials. We kindly remind users to carefully check the purposes and use instructions of products, making sure the products meet their standards to avoid making mistakes in a hurry," she said.

Chinese authorities have adopted stricter measures to ensure the quality of medical supply exports since Wednesday, requiring exporters to provide extra documentation during customs clearance to prove that their products meet the quality standards of importing countries or regions.

Hua accused some media outlets of being irresponsible in hyping up a so-called quality issue with Chinese products before checking the facts.

"I hope they don't have ulterior motives because that will not help international cooperation in epidemic control," she said
