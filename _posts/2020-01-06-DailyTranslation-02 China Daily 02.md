## （翻译）习近平的呼吁为抗疫定下基调  

***观察员表示，互助协作是世界战胜传染病的重中之重***  

在COVID-19已经强烈关切到全球公共健康问题的情况下，针对新型冠状病毒肺炎爆发已经蔓延到全世界带来的骤增的风险，近日G20领导人峰会上，习近平主席呼吁“全球全面抗击”这场传染病。

观察员表示，习近平在周四的20国集团领导人视频会议上释放出的齐心协力互助协作的信息是世界战胜传染病和防止全球经济衰退的唯一道路。  

这场G20历史上的首次网络峰会，是自新冠病毒爆发以来习近平主席出席的第一场重要的多国活动。习近平一直通过与外国领导人和国际组织进行电话交流、联系和会议的方式，强调中国会与其余世界各国共同抗击病毒。  

“在这种时刻，国际社会急须加强信心、统一行动、共同做出集体性的反应，”习近平在峰会上表示，“我们必须全面提升国际合作，形成更大的合力，只有这样全人类才能战胜这场严重的传染病。”  

习近平做出评论的同时，中国传染的控制持续强化，恢复正常工作和生活的趋势也正在巩固。据世界卫生组织WHO，病毒在全球已经蔓延到200多个国家和地区，超过616700的人被感染，死亡人数飞速增高。由于很多商业与贸易在大规模的封锁中陷入停滞，经济损失也急剧增加。

英国政策和国际关系分析师Tom Fowfy说这场病毒是一个全球性的挑战，病毒不会区分国家和文化，因此我们需要全球反应才能应对。  

尽管一些国家竭力将其归咎于某一特定的国家，并且看到了这样做能带来的机会，但实际上新冠肺炎的爆发对所有国家的人道主义、政策和经济利益都造成了伤害。Fowdy如是表示。

中国一直以来主张全球合作共同抗击传染病，并且一直在与其它国家和国际组织协调政策、共享信息和经验。  

中国已经向89个国家和四个国际组织提供了协助以控制这场传染病，包括向世界卫生组织WHO捐献了2000万美元口罩和其他医疗设备。  

同时中国向伊朗、伊拉克、意大利、塞尔维亚、柬埔寨和巴基斯坦等国派出了医疗专家小组，向英国派遣了一支联合任务组，去帮助这些国家抗击传染病。未来还会向需要的国家排除更多的医疗小组。  

中国也同来自许多国际组织和国家的卫生专家进行了视频会议，向全世界超过100个国家和十多个国际组织共享了包括新冠肺炎防控方案、确诊和治疗指南等在内的技术文档。   

习近平在峰会期间表示，所有国家必须合作建立起一个迄今最强的疾病控制和治疗的全球网络。

“中国已经建立了线上COVID-19知识中心，向所有国家开放。现在急需集中各国力量加速药品、疫苗和检测能力的研究和发展，以期早日实现突破、惠及各方。”

## (Original artitle) Experts: Xi's call sets right tone for battle   

***Mutual assistance is essential for world to prevail over contagion, say observers***

Amid the mounting risks the novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak has brought to the world, President Xi Jinping's call for "an all-out global war" against the pandemic at the recent G20 Extraordinary Leader's Summit on COVID-19 has great relevance to addressing the global public health crisis.

The messages of solidarity and mutual assistance Xi sent at the videoconference for leaders of the Group of 20 countries on Thursday are the only way out for the world to prevail over the contagion and save the global economy from recession, observers said.

The virtual summit, the first of its kind in the history of the G20, is the first major multilateral event Xi participated in since the start of the outbreak. Xi has been using telephone conversations, correspondence and meetings with leaders of foreign countries and international organizations to strengthen coordination between China and the rest of the world on the fight against the virus.

"At such a moment, it is imperative for the international community to strengthen confidence, act with unity and work together in a collective response," Xi said at the summit. "We must comprehensively step up international cooperation and foster greater synergy so that humanity as one could win the battle against such a major infectious disease."

Xi's remarks came as China's epidemic control is continuously improving and the trend of restoring normal work and life is being consolidated. Globally, the virus has spread to more than 200 countries and regions. Over 616,700 people have been infected and the death toll is still rising rapidly, according to the World Health Organization. The economic toll is also climbing as more businesses and trade comes to a halt amid massive lockdowns.

Tom Fowdy, a British political and international relations analyst, said the virus is a global challenge which requires a global response as it does not discriminate in terms of nationality or culture.

Although some nations have endeavored to pin it on one specific country and seen opportunities in doing so, in practice the outbreak harms the humanitarian, political, and economic interests of every nation, Fowdy said.

China has always advocated international cooperation in the fight against the epidemic. It has been endeavoring to coordinate policies and share information and experiences with other countries and international organizations.

The country has offered aid to 89 countries and four international organizations to contain the epidemic, including donations of face masks or other medical equipment and as well as $20 million to the WHO.

China has also sent teams of medical experts to Iran, Iraq, Italy, Serbia, Cambodia and Pakistan as well as a joint task force to the United Kingdom to help those countries fight the epidemic. More medical teams are expected to be sent to countries in need.

China has also held video conferences with health experts from many international organizations and countries. It also shared technical documents, including epidemic prevention and control measures, as well as diagnosis and treatment plans, with more than 100 countries around the world and over 10 international and regional organizations.

Xi said during the summit that all nations must work together to build the strongest global network of disease control and treatment that the world has ever seen.

"China has set up its online COVID-19 knowledge center that is open to all countries. It is imperative that countries pool their strengths and speed up research and development of drugs, vaccines and testing capabilities in the hope to achieve early breakthrough to the benefit of all."
