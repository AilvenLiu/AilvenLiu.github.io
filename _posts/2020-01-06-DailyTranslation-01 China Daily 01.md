## （翻译）华为今年将投入2亿美元建设计算生态系统   
华为技术有限公司本周五表示，今年将投入两亿美元支持第三方开发者使用其计算解决方案，这家中国技术巨头再一次强调了其对计算的长期承诺。  

这一动作是华为在2019年提出的更广泛的15亿美元一揽子计划的一部分，该计划将在未来五年持续投资建设一个充满活力的的开发者生态系统。   

华为云和人工智能事业群总裁侯金龙表示：“开发者是改变计算世界的核心，他们是企业创新的引擎，是新产业生态的灵魂。”他解释道，“我们将持续与全球开发者和业界伙伴合作，利用鲲鹏处理器多核高并发的优势，提供强大且经济的算力。同时，我们将开拓计算产业万亿美元的蓝海市场，共享数字经济的成功。” 鲲鹏处理器由华为基于ARM芯片架构开发，后者是英国Arm控股开发的一种芯片设计。  

侯表示，当下有160万开发者在华为云进行工作，到2025年末这一数字有希望达到500万。  

商业战略和经济咨询机构Forrester的首席分析师Dai表示，华为的计算策略证明了利用整体的硬软件频谱全面释放人工智能云端算力的重要性。   

Dai补充说，基于ARM的芯片有着不可取代的计算价值，华为对基于ARM的服务器的投入不仅能对广泛的商业场景提供支持，还能有效地增强在日益变化的宏观经济环境中的商业敏锐度。   

分析师称中国近来对发展如数据中心此类的新基建的强调将给华为的计算商业带来机遇。   

本月早些时候，共产党中央委员会的一场政治局常委会议呼吁更加努力地建设新基建，包括5G基站和数据中心。  

侯表示：“数字社会的基建就是算力，华为在这方面有独一无二的优势。我们希望与所有的开发者伙伴们共同建设中国新基建。”  

本周五华为同时宣布了其正在与一些合作伙伴，如腾讯游戏，共同建设鲲鹏生态系统，公司希望鲲鹏可以成为未来多方市场中IT产业发展的基石。这(建设鲲鹏生态)对于所有数字经济参与者都是互惠互利的事情。   

(去年)11月，华为携手广东省重点科研机构鹏程实验室，发布了一个称作云脑(CloudBrain)的升级版AI计算系统。该系统是一个底层架构，对广泛的应用比如智慧医疗、智能交通和城市管理等提供支持。   

鹏程实验室主管高文说：“在第一阶段，云脑的计算能力会有一个五倍的提升，再过一年又能在此基础上再强化十倍。这之后，云脑就是世界上最大规模的AI计算集群。”   

## (The original version) Huawei to invest $200 million this year in building computing ecosystem   
Huawei Technologies Co said in Friday it will invest $200 million this year to support third-party developers that use its computing solutions, as the Chinese tech giant underlines once again its long-term commitment to computing.   

The move is part of broader $1.5 billion package that Huawei announced in 2019 that it would invest over the next 5 years to build a vibrant ecosystem of developers.   

"Developers are the key to changing the computing world. They are the engine of enterprise innovations, and soul of new industry ecosystem," Hou Jinlong, president of Huawei's Cloud & AI business group, said.    

"We will continue to work with global developer and industry partners to provide robust, economical computing power by leveraging the multi-core, high-concurrency advantages of Kunpeng processors. Together, we will unlock the trillion dollor bule ocean market of the computing industry and share the success of digital economy," Hou explained.   

Kunpeng processors are developed by Huawei on the basis of ARM chip architecture, a chip design developed by the British company Arm Holding.   

Hou said the company now has 1.6 million developer working on  Huawei Cloud, and it hopes to increase the number to 5 million developers by the end of 2025.   

Charlie Dai, principal analyst at business strategy and economic consultandy Forrester, said Huawei's computing strategy demonstrates the improtance of leveraging holistic hardware and software spectrum to fully unleash the power of AI in cloud.   

ARM-based chips have unique value for computing. Huawei's investment in ARM-based servers not only supports broader business scenarios. It also effictively improves business agility in the increasingly dynamic macroeconomic environment, Dai added.   

Analysts said China's recent emphasis on developing new infrastructure such as data center will bring oppotunities for Huawei's computing business.   

Early this month, a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee called for accelerated efforts to build new infrastructure, including 5G base station and data centers, in China.   

Hou said: "The infrastructure for a digital society is computing power and Huawei has a unique edge in this respect. We hope to partner with all developers to build China's new infrastructure."   

Huawei also announced on Fridy it is working with parnters such as Tencent Game to be part of the Kunpeng ecosystem and the company hopes that Kunpeng can become the fundation for future IT development in multiple markets. It added this will mutually benefit all players in the digital economy.   

In November, Huawei partnered with Peng Cheng Lab, a key research facility in Guangdong province, to launch an upgraded AI computing system called CloudBrain. The system is an undeylying architecture to support a wide range of applications such as smart healthcare, smart transportation and urban management.   

"In the first stage, CloudBrain's computing ability will increase five times and it will be enhanced by another 10 times next year. It will become the world's largest AI computing cluster by then," PCL director Gao Wen said.
