## （翻译）务必要加紧国际合作，不要贸易限制

当全世界都在为COVID-19的爆发给全球供应链带来的破坏而深深忧切的时候，一些美国官员却试图通过政治强权给正常的供应合作的破裂火上浇油。   

据一份新提出的提案，一些美国政客意图裁断中国电子通信巨头华为的全球供应链。这一份刚出炉的规则的变化要求，在未来，使用美国芯片制造技术和软件的外国公司像华为出售特定类型芯片之前要先得到美国的许可。     

这一举动毫无疑问会给全世界增添沉重的负担，而处于新型冠状病毒瘟疫阴影下的全球此时正挣扎于破碎的供应链和日益缩减的贸易规模。考虑到华为的庞大商业规模及其在全球数以千计的供应商，如果该提案被接受，其将会不可避免地让事情更糟糕。    

作为全球顶尖的通讯设备供应商和第二大的智能手机出货商，华为每年都会购买不计其数的芯片和相关产品及服务。其购货方包括高通、英特尔、镁光等美国半导体公司，也有如Arm控股、NXP半导体等欧洲供应商。    

这些美国政客意欲对华为的所为是对这家中国企业运营的的野蛮干涉，这将破坏全球芯片相关供应链的正常运转，届时所有以这条供应链为生的公司都无可避免地受到波及。    

据波士顿咨询集团，其最新的、自自2019年五月美国政府限制对像华为出口特定的技术产品作出限制以来的季度报告显示，美国顶尖的半导体公司都报告了在4到9个百分点直接的中等规模的利益下滑。     

这份报告还表明，如果美国加强对中国的半导体贸易限制，会令它自己在该领域的领导地位陷入困境。   

波士顿咨询集团警告到，如果美国中止对中国的芯片和芯片制造设备供应，同时中国也对美国的电子设备和软件施加禁令，会让美国公司损失37个百分点的年度销售额。   

然而一些激进的美国政客丝毫不顾这些警告，仍然固执地追求他们毫无把握的议程。如果他们的提案被批准，遭受最大损失的正是美国芯片公司和美国半导体产业。   

这也解释了为什么九个美国产业集团据报道正奋力反击这项缩紧对华为出售芯片的规则的提案。路透社报道，在周一发出的一份信件中，这九个集团力劝美国商务部，在法案正式生效前开发公众评论以避免不必要的结果。    

华为创始人任正非曾说，美国就像喜马拉雅山脉上的水，它可以流下山来滋润植物。但如果它执意待在山巅，拒绝滋润山脚下的植物，就会被冻住变成冰川。    

如果美国政府在这个领域(译注：半导体和芯片)利用其技术优势去割裂全球供应链，那么美国在这个领域的产业就会有丧失活力的风险。并且，其他国家发展出它们自己的相同甚至更好质量的替代品只是一个时间问题。     

历史已经表明，中国的企业善于把危机转化成其脱颖而出的机会。五年以前，华盛顿禁止了向中国出售用于高性能计算机的高级处理器。这一禁令最终加速了中国国产CPU的开发。在2017年，开发出了其自有的用于高性能计算机的CPU：SW26010。    

作为全球最大的5G和智能手机市场，中国在电子通讯和电子产业方面已经取得了长足的进步。很多美国科技公司，比如高通和苹果，都在很大程度上依赖中国市场以盈利和支撑起供应链。    

与一些美国政客在疫情期间威胁割裂芯片相关供应链的卑鄙行为相反，中国一直都在努力帮助国际公司在中国的工厂恢复生产，以稳定全球供应链。    

中国最近正在加速制造业、商业和科技公司——比如医药产品制造商——的复工复产，以保证全球供应。   

在这场数十年来的全世界最大的医疗卫生挑战中，抗击病毒和恢复商业活动需要的是加紧全球合作，而不是切断联系和贸易限制。   

## (Original article)    

As the world is deeply concerned with the COVID-19 outbreak's disruptions on the global supply chain, some US officials have attempted to pour oil on the flames by using political forces to sever normal supply cooperation.

A new proposal has been reportedly put forward by some US politicians to cut Chinese telecom heavyweight Huawei from global supply chains. The proposed rule change will require foreign companies that use US-made chipmaking technology and software to obtain a license from the US before selling designated types of chips to Huawei.

Such a move will undoubtedly add a burden on the world, which is already struggling with fragmentation of supplies and dwindling trade volumes amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. If adopted, the proposal will inevitably make things worse, given the sprawling size of Huawei's business and its thousands of suppliers around the world.

As the top telecom equipment maker and the second-largest smartphone vendor in the world, Huawei purchases tons of chips, relevant products and services every year from US semiconductor chip companies, including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp and Micron Technology, as well as European suppliers, such as Arm Holdings and NXP Semiconductors.

While what those US politicians are hoping to do to Huawei is a barbarian intervention in the operation of the Chinese company, it would disrupt the normal functioning of the global chip-related supply chain, and all companies that rely on this chain to survive will suffer.

Boston Consulting Group said in its latest report that in each of the three quarters after the US government restricted sales of certain technology products to Huawei in May 2019, the top US semiconductor makers have reported a median revenue decline of between 4 percent and 9 percent.

If the US increases restrictions on the semiconductor trade with China, it could endanger its own position as leader in the sector, the report added.

The BCG also warned that if shipments of US chips and chip making equipment to China were stopped, and China banned imports of US electronics and software, it could cost US companies 37 percent of their annual sales.

Some scaremongering US politicians, however, totally go against such warnings and remain pigheaded in pursuing their dubious agenda. If their proposal were approved, it is the US chip companies and the US semiconductor industry that stand to suffer the most.

That explains why nine US industry groups are reportedly pushing back on the proposed changes to tighten chip sale rules to Huawei. Reuters reported that in a letter sent on Monday, the nine groups urged the US Department of Commerce to allow public comments before putting the rules into effect to avoid unintended consequences.

Ren Zhengfei, founder of Huawei, once said the US is just like ice water on the Himalayas; it can flow down the mountains to water the plants. But if it stays on top of the mountains and refuses to water the plants at the foot of the mountains, it will freeze and become a glacier.

If the US government leverages its technological superiority in an area to sever the global supply chain, the US industry in that area will risk losing vitality, and it is just a matter of time before other countries develop their own alternatives of equal or even better quality.

History has already showed that Chinese companies excel in turning a crisis into an opportunity to stand out. Five years ago, Washington banned sales of premium processors to China's high-performance computers. The ban ended up accelerating China's development of its own CPUs. In 2017, China came up with its own chip for high-performance computers: The SW26010.

As the world's largest 5G and smartphone market, China has already made constant progress in telecommunication and electronics industries. A string of US tech firms, including Qualcomm and Apple, heavily rely on the China market for revenue and supply chains.

Contrary to some US politicians' despicable practices of threatening to sever chip-related supply chains amid the pandemic, China has been scrambling to help local factories of international companies resume production to help stabilize global supply chains.

China has recently stepped up resumption at manufacturing, commercial and logistic firms, such as pharmaceutical product manufacturers, to ensure the global supply.

Amid the world's biggest healthcare challenge in decades, it is closer global cooperation, not disconnection and trade restrictions, that is needed to fight the virus and restore business activities.
