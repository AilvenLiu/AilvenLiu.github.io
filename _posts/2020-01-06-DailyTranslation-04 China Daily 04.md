## （翻译）习近平强调绿色增长模式   
***主席说丰厚的经济红利来源于保护环境***   

周一在华东视察行程中的一个小村子里，习近平主席强调了环境保护问题的重要性。十五年前习近平在这个小村庄提出了生态文明理论。  

中共中央总书记、中央军委主席习近平近日来到浙江省安吉县的一个小村庄——余村，在此谈到环境保护问题。  

习近平表示，保护绿水青山能给村子的长久发展提供独特的优势，经济发展也不应当以破坏环境为代价。“环境本身就是财富，保护环境者也会收到自然的回馈。”    

他说，建设现代社会主义国家同时包含了城市和边远地区的现代化。在实现全面建设现代小康社会的目标之后，政府应当全方位促进偏远地区发展、建设美丽乡村。习近平表示余村的发展证明了绿色发展是一条正确的道路，未来应当继续进行。    

2005年习近平曾到访这个村子，赞扬地方政府停止挖矿活动、关闭水泥工厂以应对当时一系列污染问题。在那次行程中，习近平提出了他著名的“绿水青山是无价财富”的发展理论，后来这被称为“两山理论”。   

在中国中央电视台放出的一个视频片段中，在15年前举行的一场会议上，时任中共浙江省委书记的习近平对地方官员说：“你刚刚做出的关闭一些矿井的决定是明智之举，绿水青山才是无价的财富。”    

余村现在已经是广受沪宁杭等城市居民喜爱的乡村风景名胜。今天这个村庄拥有280户人家，2009年人均收入达到了人民币49598元（7040美元）。

余村前村委书记潘文革告诉记者：“两山理论改变了村庄面貌，加速了村庄的改变、把村民的收入提高了六倍。” 他又补充道，余村通过绿色发展寻求乡村振兴的成功经验在过去15年间不仅提高了村民收入，也增强了了他们的社会意识。村子已经有10年没有过法律纠纷或犯罪事件了。   

2019年，村子登记了 2800万元的经济收入，成为了浙江偏远地区全面建设小康社会的模范。   

“下一步我们会和周围的村子一起，共同促进偏远地区协作发展，”余村村长王玉成在周一向视察中的习近平介绍村子未来发展计划是如是说道。   

## (Original article)  
***President says care for environment provides rich economic dividends***

President Xi Jinping stressed the importance of environmental protection during his inspection tour of eastern China on Monday at a village where he unveiled his theory of ecological civilization 15 years ago.

Xi, who is also general secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military Commission, visited Yucun, a village in Anji county of Zhejiang province, and talked about environmental protection.

Protecting the mountains and waters well will provide special advantages for the further development of the village, Xi said, adding that the economy should not be developed at the cost of destroying the environment.

"The environment itself means the economy. If you protect the environment, you will receive rewards from the environment," he said.

Building a modern socialist country includes both the modernization of urban and rural areas, Xi said.

After the goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects is fulfilled, the government will promote rural development in all respects and build more beautiful villages, Xi said.

The development of Yucun proves that green development is the right path, which should be carried on in the future, Xi said.

In August 2005, Xi visited the village to praise the local government for stopping mining activities and closing cement factories to deal with the then serious pollution problem. During the visit, Xi put forward his famous development theory of "lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets", which was later known as the "Two Mountains Theory".

"Just now you said that you've made the decision to shut down some mines, which is a wise move. Lucid waters and lush mountains are invaluable assets," Xi, then Party secretary of Zhejiang province, told the local officials at a meeting held 15 years ago, according to a video released by China Central Television.

Yucun now stands out as a rural scenic attraction visited by urban residents of places such as Shanghai, Hangzhou and Nanjing.

Today, the village has 280 households and its residents earned a per capita income of 49,598 yuan ($7,040) in 2019.

"The Two Mountains Theory has given a face-lift and resulted in fascinating changes to the village, improving the residents' income six times," Pan Wenge, former Party secretary of Yucun, told China Daily.

He added that Yucun's successful experience, seeking rural revitalization through green development, has not only raised villagers' incomes over the past 15 years, but also helped to improve their social awareness.

The village has witnessed no lawsuit or criminal case for the past 10 years, he said.

In 2019, the village registered a gross economic income of 280 million yuan, becoming a model of the comprehensive construction of a well-off society in rural Zhejiang.

"For our next step, we are working with nearby villages to boost regional collaborative rural development," said Wang Yucheng, head of Yucun, who briefed Xi about the village's future plan during his inspection tour on Monday.
