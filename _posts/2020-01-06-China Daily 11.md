华为技术公司在周四表示，尽管面临着COVID-19传染病和美国政府的限制令，包括智能手机、个人电脑和平板电脑等产品在内的消费者事业部依然期望能在中国快速成长。   

该公司周三在国内发布了其高端智能机P40系列后做出了上面所述的预言。其中该智能手机拥有完全不依赖谷歌服务的独立开发的操作系统。    

华为消费者事业部首席执行官余承东告诉中国日报，公司在中国的智能手机销售额已经恢复，并在三月快速增长。“尽管销售额在二月有衰减，但我们也看到一月和三月的增长，这有助于维持第一季度的增长，”余承东表示。    

然而这个高级领导也警告传染病的流行会在今年全年阻碍全球智能手机市场的发展。他说道，“避免全球智能手机行业的衰落是绝无可能的事，我们会尽全力不掉得那么快。”   

据余承东，由于更多的人居家学习和工作，华为平板的销量稳固上升。华为正在有条不紊地推进华为手机服务，也被称为HMS，这是该公司能继续在国外市场销售智能手机的基石。     

自从美国政府禁止该公司在其移动设备上使用谷歌产品和服务后，HMS这一被设计用以替代谷歌手机服务的框架开始应用。    

“我们不仅缩短了和GMS之间的差距，还建立了我们HMS自己的优势，”余承东补充道，该公司基于HMS的P40 Lite智能手机在海外市场卖得很好。   

这位资深高管说道，P40系列在除了美国、巴西和韩国之外的市场都有销售，但是现在的疫情影响了公司在西欧的贸易。    

一些早期的报告提及美国政客正考虑逐步强化对华为销售半导体的控制。余承东回应说，一旦这个提案被接受，将会极大地伤害美国供应商的发展前景。余承东说：“如果市场没有恶化，我们有信心维持良好的发展。”    

根据一份来自市场调查公司**战略分析师(Strategy Analytics)**的最近的调查报告，在超过1300个调查对象中有接近百分之三十七的人表示会推迟购买新智能手机的计划，百分之三十二的人表示他们会推迟升级到5G服务的计划。   

战略分析师公司智能手机研究主管钱岁表示智能手机供应链和生态看起来会在第二季度恢复，但是显然大部分消费者不准备恢复传染病前的购买模式。他表示，通信运营商，智能手机供应商和零售门店必须努力使消费者相信购买一部新的智能手机是值得的事情。

Huawei Technologies Co said on Thursday that it expects revenue from its consumer business group, which includes smartphones, personal computers and tablets, to grow fast in China, despite the COVID-19 pandemic and the US government restrictions.

The forecast came after the company launched its latest high-end P40 series of smartphones in China on Wednesday, which have an indigenously developed operating system without any dependence on Google services.

Yu Chengdong, CEO of Huawei's consumer business group, told China Daily that the company's smartphone sales have been recovering in China and saw a big growth in March.

"Though sales declined in February, we saw growth in January and March, which helped maintain an expansion in the first quarter," Yu said.

But the senior executive warned that the pandemic could crimp global smartphone markets for the whole year.

"It is almost impossible to avoid a decline in the global smartphone business. We will try hard not to post a drop," Yu said.

According to Yu, tablet sales have been improving steadily as more people stay at home for work and study. Huawei is making steady progress in promoting Huawei Mobile Services, better known as HMS, which is the foundation for the company to continue selling smartphones in overseas markets.

HMS is designed to replace Google Mobile Service, after the US government banned the company from using Google's products and services in its mobile devices.

"We have not only shortened the gap with GMS, but also built our own edge in HMS," Yu said, adding that the company's P40 Lite smartphones, powered by HMS, have sold well in overseas markets.

The senior executive said the P40 series will be available in all markets except for the United States, Brazil and South Korea. But currently, the pandemic is affecting the company's businesses in western Europe.

Some reports had earlier suggested that US politicians were considering steps to further contain semiconductor sales to Huawei. Yu said the proposal, if approved, will severely harm the business prospects of US suppliers.

"If the market does not deteriorate, we are confident of maintaining good growth," Yu said.

According to a recent report from market research company Strategy Analytics, nearly 37 percent of the over 1,300 respondents it surveyed said they would defer plans to buy new smartphones, while 32 percent indicated they would postpone plans to upgrade to 5G services.

Sui Qian, research director of smartphones at Strategy Analytics, said smartphone supply chains and ecosystem are likely to recover in the second quarter, but apparently, a large number of consumers are not ready to return to the pre-pandemic purchasing patterns.

Telecom carriers, smartphone vendors and retailers must step up efforts to convince consumers that it is worthwhile to buy new smartphones, Sui said.
