# （翻译）美国新冠病毒感染者超20万    
据美国卫生官员，本周三美国已经有超过20万人新冠病毒检测呈阳性，相比五天前翻了一番。   

据美国国家卫生部，纽约以超过8.3万人阳性的结果贡献了大部分病例，这其中有超过4.7万病例发生在纽约城。   

纽约时报在周三报道，川普政府一名高级官员说，由于各州州长请求继续为绝望的医院工作人员提供防护设备，联邦政府现已几乎倾尽了口罩、手套、防护服等紧急医疗防护物资。这位不愿透露姓名的高级官员说联邦政府仍有9400多台呼吸机可以分发部署。   

这位官员表示联邦紧急事务署已经调配了超过1160万N95口罩、520万防护面具，2200万防手套和714-台呼吸机，紧急库存正在耗尽。   

州长Andrew Cuomo说，纽约州因新冠而死亡的人数持续增多，就在过去的24小时内就死亡了391人。该州已经有超过2000人因新冠病毒而死亡，几乎占到了全美的一半。“这个数字将持续走高，”州长在周三的每日新闻发布会上如是表达道。    

Cuomo同时表示，截至周三下午纽约已经有83712个确诊病例，比昨天增加了7917例。   

相关模型指出，纽约州新冠病毒疫情的的顶点“大约出现在4月末，这意味着还有一个月才能达到该顶点，”Cuomo说道。他也表示模型可能会随时间而改变。   

盖茨基金会的预测估计美国会有9.3万人死亡，其中纽约州有超过1.6万。Cuomo说，“这份预测也是对全国其余各州而言，不只是纽约州。”     

道琼斯工业指数均值下降了973.65点，跌幅4.4个百分点。现值降到了20943.51点，是表现最差的季度首个交易日。标普500掉114.09点，跌幅4.4，现值接近2470.50点。纳斯达克综合指数下滑339.52点，跌幅4.4，现值接近7360.58点。    

美股三大指数至此都失去了其在2月份达到的最高值的至少四分之一的市值。  

## (Original article)   

More than 200,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the coronavirus as of Wednesday, doubling the number of cases from just five days ago, according to health officials.

Most of the cases are in New York, where more than 83,000 people have tested positive, including more than 47,000 in New York City, according to the state health department.

The New York Times reported on Wednesday that a senior Trump administration official said the federal government has nearly emptied its emergency stockpile of protective medical supplies like masks, gowns and gloves, as state governors continue to plea for protective gear for desperate hospital workers.

The senior official – who was not identified by name — said the administration still has more than 9,400 ventilators ready to be deployed.

The official said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delivered more than 11.6 million N95 masks, 5.2 million face shields, 22 million gloves and 7,140 ventilators, exhausting the emergency stockpile.

New York state's death toll from the coronavirus continued to increase, with 391 people dying in the latest 24-hour period, Governor Andrew Cuomo said. The virus has killed nearly 2,000 people in the state, almost half the US total.

"That number will continue to go up," Cuomo said at his daily news conference on Wednesday.

Cuomo also said that there were 83,712 confirmed cases as of Wednesday afternoon, an increase of 7,917.

Models indicate the apex of the coronavirus outbreak in the state will hit "roughly at the end of April, which means another month of this," Cuomo said. He said that the model could change over time.

Cuomo said projection from the Gates Foundation estimated 93,000 US deaths, including 16,000 in New York state. "What that does say to the rest of the nation is that this is not just New York," Cuomo said.

On Wall Street, stocks opened the second quarter of 2020 with a selloff on Wednesday, with investors fearing the impact of the coronavirus on the US economy.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 973.65 points, or 4.4 percent, to 20943.51, marking its worst first day of a quarter.

The S&P 500 fell 114.09, or 4.4 percent, to close at 2470.50. The Nasdaq Composite slid 339.52, or 4.4 percent, to close at 7360.58.

All three indexes have lost at least one-quarter of their value since closing at record highs in February.
