## （翻译）麒麟以新操作系统冲击全球巨头   

麒麟软件，这个由两大国内顶尖软件和操作系统生产商——中国标准软件和天津麒麟信息——的联合体组合而成的新公司，将开发一款名为麒麟的独立的操作系统，该操作系统预期产出1万亿人民币(1412亿美元)的工业产值。公司的一名经理说道。    

“顺应人工智能、移动计算和下一代云连接技术的趋势，这家公司也将建设三种产品，分别是：桌面端和服务器操作系统、云操作系统和嵌入式操作系统，”麒麟软件副总经理李振宁说。   

合并前的两家公司在中国电子集团旗下。他们宣称将携手天津市政府、在这个华北自治区设立总部发展自有独立的操作系统。   

中国电子集团称，在接下来的五年里将投资百亿元人民币、培育一个超过一万名研究人员的精英团队去发展国有操作。   

“麒麟操作系统的发展有望打开中国的新篇章，改变本土操作系统公司规模小、市场扭曲与细分的现状。”李振宁说到。  

李振宁表示，由于公司试图五年内在天津建立一个超过一万人的团队，从而整合人力资源是实现上述目标的最大挑战。   

“我们设立一个在今年形成一千人规模的团队的最新举措，以应对这一挑战。我们会与本地软硬件公司合作以建立一个用户友好的本土软硬件平台和解决方案，”李振宁讲。   

未来，麒麟软件期望中国的操作系统市场更加可兼容，这也会帮助建立一个更好的相关产业生态。   

天津市工业和信息技术局首席经济专家周晟熙说，他们正努力“培育一个本土芯片飞腾、操作系统制造商天津麒麟和超级计算机之间的产业生态。天河超算和超算制造商曙光的总部都在这座城市。”   

中国软件操作系统产业现在被外国公司所支配，比如微软的Windows，谷歌的Android和苹果公司的Mac OS.   

飞腾-麒麟系统的发展正在改变这一现状，其已经成为国家银行和军队部门主要使用的操作系统。   

天津麒麟信息技术有限公司总经理孔金珠说到，中国前十名操作系统制造商投资的总和还不及微软投资的百分之一。    

中国工程院院士倪光南说，我们需要更加努力地去加速核心技术领域的自主创新、建立安全的国产信息技术系统。    

中国标准软件和天津麒麟在他们的产品中部分共享了麒麟这个名字。中国标准软件开发的优麒麟Linux操作系统和天津麒麟开发的麒麟服务器操作系统，是市场上最重要的两个国产操作系统。这两个系统的图标是中国文化中的一种吉祥动物，麒麟。   

中国标准软件总经理韩奈平说，优麒麟Linux操作系统完全支持国内外主要的开源硬件平台，拥有服务器版本和桌面端版本，兼容四千多款软硬件产品。  

## (Original article)   
Kylin Software, a newly merged company from the union of the two leading domestic software and operating system makers－China Standard Software and Tianjin Kylin Information, will develop an independent OS under the name of Kylin, which is expected to generate an industrial value of 1 trillion yuan ($141.2 billion), a company executive said.

"Riding on the tide of artificial intelligence, mobile computing and cloud-connected next generation technologies, the company will build three products. They are a desktop and server operating system, a cloud operating system and an embedded operating system," Kylin Software vice-general manager Li Zhenning said.

The two companies were previously under China Electronics Corp. They also announced they were joining hands with the Tianjin municipal government to develop a self-independent OS whose headquarters will be in the North China municipality.

CEC said it will invest tens of billions of yuan and nurture an elite team of over 10,000 researchers to develop a domestic operating system in the next five years.

"The evolution of the Kylin OS is expected to open a new chapter for China, changing the status quo that local OS companies are mostly small scale with a distorted and segmented market," he said.

To achieve those targets, Li said the top challenge would be to harness human resources as the company tries to establish a team of over 10,000 in the next five years in Tianjin.

"To tackle the challenges, our latest move will see the formation of a 1,000-people team this year. We will partner with local software and hardware companies to build user-friendly homegrown software and hardware platforms and solutions," he said.

In the future, the company expects China's OS market to be more compatible, and it will help build a better ecology among related industries.

Zhou Shengxi, the chief economist of the Tianjin Municipal Industry and Information Technology Bureau, said they are making efforts to "foster an industrial ecology among homegrown chip Phytium, OS maker Tianjin Kylin, and supercomputers. Tianhe supercomputer and supercomputer maker Shuguang are headquartered in the city."

China's software OS industry is currently dominated by foreign companies such as Microsoft's Windows, Google's Android and Apple's Mac OS.

Development of the Phytium-Kylin systems is now changing the situation as it has become a major OS used in the country's banking and military sectors.

Kong Jinzhu, general manager of the Tianjin Kylin Information Technology Co Ltd, said that the combined investment for the top 10 Chinese OS makers was no more than 1 percent of the figure invested by Microsoft.

Ni Guangnan, an academician with the Chinese Academy of Engineering, said more efforts are needed to accelerate independent innovations in core technologies and establish a safe domestic information technology system.

China Standard Software and Tianjin Kylin partly shared the name of Kylin in their products.

The NeoKylin Linux OS developed by China Standard Software and the Kylin server OS developed by Tianjin Kylin are the two most important domestic OS products in the market. The logo of the two systems is Kylin, an auspicious animal in Chinese culture.

The NeoKylin Linux OS fully supports mainstream open hardware platforms at home and abroad, covering the server version and the desktop version, and it is compatible with more than 4,000 software and hardware products, said Han Naiping, general manager of China Standard Software.
