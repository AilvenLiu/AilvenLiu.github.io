牛津大学现代中国历史和政策教授Rana Mitter说，习主席强调的国际合作是战胜新冠病毒威胁的唯一可行的道路。英国已经为实现这个目标做出了重大举措：承诺将投入2100万英镑（合2620万美元）开发疫苗，更重要的需要各个国家共同向这个重要目标而努力。  

吉尔吉思斯坦前总理、北师大一带一路学院杰出教授Djoomart Otorbaev说只有开展多边合作才能战胜病毒。  

“在这个全人类的关键时刻，在狭隘的民族主义与国际伙伴关系的选择上不应该有任何一丝犹豫，”Otorbeav通过发表在中国国际电视网络网站上的一篇文章如是表达到。他又补充说，必须把抗击健康威胁和应对经济挑战这两个支柱作为紧急行动计划根基。   

在周四峰会的讲话上习近平强调了G20成员国需要运用和协调其各自的宏观政策以降低不利影响、防止世界经济陷入衰退，习主席还呼吁全部G20成员做出集体性的行动，缩减关税、消除贸易壁垒、加强贸易自由流动。   

习主席说G20国家需要共同维持全球产业和供应链稳定，中国将加强对世界市场药用原材料、日用品、抗疫和其他物资等的支持。主席表示，“中国将通过继续促进改革开发，放宽市场准入，提升商业环境，扩大进口和对外投资等措施对世界经济稳定做出贡献。”   

中国国际经济交流中心副主席、前商务部副部长魏建国对新华社新闻代表说，世界正处于抗击传染病疫情和稳定全球经济的关键节点，国际社会期待G20起到带头作用。  

周四会议的急迫性和重要性与2008年全球经济危机时相当，当时G20财长与央行行长会议被提高到国家和政府首领会议的地位以强化危机协作。然而专家担心的是，从经济基准点来看，这次由疫情引发的可能比2008年经济危机来得更猛烈。  

“传染病将对经济产生不可逆的巨大影响，”在世界贸易组织发布的一个视频片段中，该组织的总干事Roberto Azevedo表示到。“最近的预测显示本次经济倒退和失业危机会比十二年前的全球金融危机更糟糕。”  

英国一家多国资产管理公司Schroders已经将其对今年全球经济增长率的预测降低到了2.3%。莫迪表示G20国家的GDP将缩减0.5个百分点。Goldman Sachs预测除非COVID-19感染人数在四月份急剧下降，否则今年下半年全球经济复苏的机会极其渺茫。   

Charhar研究所国际问题高级研究员赵明昊表示，就算说人类正面临着自二战以来的最大危机也毫不夸张。由于其在包括公共卫生、经济和社会等的多个维度给人类施加以极度重大的挑战使，本次危机将更加严重。   

注意到这次危机爆发凸显了非传统安全挑战带给人类的严重威胁，赵表示时间和资源不应再浪费在所谓的主要国家战略竞争中了。   

赵明昊说：“即使美国和全世界正面临着日益严重的传染病威胁，一些华盛顿的精英们仍在试图加剧中美之间的对抗。”

## (Original article)  

Rana Mitter, a professor of the history and politics of modern China at the University of Oxford, said Xi has rightly stressed that international cooperation is the only feasible way to defeat the menace of the coronavirus. The UK has made an important move toward this goal by pledging 210 million pounds ($262 million) to developing a vaccine, and it is vitally important that all countries join in this important aim, Mitter said.

Djoomart Otorbaev, former prime minister of Kyrgyzstan and a distinguished professor of the Belt and Road School of Beijing Normal University, said only multilateral cooperation will be able to defeat the virus.

"In this critical time for all humanity, there shouldn't be any slight hesitation of choice between petty nationalism and international partnership," Otorbaev said in an article published on the website of the China Global Television Network. Two pillars must serve as the foundation of an urgent action plan－fighting health threats and addressing economic challenges, he added.

Addressing Thursday's summit, Xi underlined the need for G20 members to leverage and coordinate their macro policies to counteract the negative impact and prevent the world economy from falling into recession, and called on all G20 members to take collective action by cutting tariffs, removing barriers and facilitating the unfettered flow of trade.

Saying that G20 countries need to jointly keep global industrial and supply chains stable, Xi said China will increase its supply of pharmaceutical ingredients, daily necessities, and anti-epidemic and other supplies to the international market. "China will contribute to a stable world economy by continuing to advance reform and opening-up, widen market access, improve the business environment and expand imports and outbound investment," he said.

Wei Jianguo, vice-chairman of the China Center for International Economic Exchanges and a former vice-minister of commerce, told Xinhua News Agency that the world is at a critical juncture in fighting the pandemic and stabilizing the global economy, and the international community expects the G20 to play a leading role.

The significance and urgency of Thursday's meeting have parallels with the global financial crisis in 2008 when meetings of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors were raised to the level of heads of state and government for improved crisis coordination. However, experts warned that from an economic standpoint, the threat posed by the pandemic is much larger than the 2008 financial crisis.

"This pandemic will inevitably have an enormous impact on the economy," World Trade Organization Director-General Roberto Azevedo said in a video clip posted on the website of the organization. "Recent projections predict an economic downturn and job losses that are worse than the global financial crisis a dozen years ago."

British multinational asset management company Schroders has cut its growth forecast for the global economy to 2.3 percent this year. Moody's said that the GDP of G20 countries will shrink by 0.5 percent. Goldman Sachs predicted that the chances of a global economic recovery in the second half of the year are very slim, unless the number of COVID-19 cases falls sharply after April.

Zhao Minghao, a senior research fellow of international studies at the Charhar Institute, said it's not an exaggeration to say that mankind is facing the worst crisis since World War II. This crisis is compounded in that it poses extremely significant challenges to humanity in multiple dimensions, including public health, the economy and society, he added.

Noting the outbreak highlights the significant threat to humanity from non-traditional security challenges, Zhao said time and resources should no longer be wasted in so-called strategic competition of major countries.

"Even as the US and the world face a worsening pandemic, some Washington elites are still seeking to intensify the confrontation between China and the US," he said
